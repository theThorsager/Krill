Krill is an plug-in for for the Rhino addon Grasshopper and provides tools to

- Preform bond-based Peridynamics calculations in 3d and 2d
- Visulize Stress tensor fields from those calculations
- Generate equivilant trusses from the stress fields
- Optimise those trusses for minimum reinforcement in a Strut and Tie Modelling context

It has been initially produced while writing an master thesis which details the underlying theory.

## Getting Started
Either use the release build or build it from source.

The release build folder should be placed in `.\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries\`.

If building from source this should happen automatically.
